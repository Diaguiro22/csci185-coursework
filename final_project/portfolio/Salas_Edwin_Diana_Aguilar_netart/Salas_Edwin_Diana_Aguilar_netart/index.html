        <h1>Like Stormy</h1>
<p>Stephanie Clifford, also known as Stormy Daniels, is a porn film star who claims that she had an affair with Donald Trump before he became U.S. president. Donald Trump now faces criminal charges from the alleged hush money paid to Stormy Daniels to avoid a scandal that could impact the 2016 election. Daniels claims that she had a sexual encounter with Trump in 2006, a year after he married Melania Trump. On October 18, 2016, Daniels signed a non-disclosure agreement where she pledged not to publicly disclose her relationship with him in exchange for a 130,000 payment, according to documents filed in Los Angeles federal court.</p>

       <h1>Like Pearls</h1>
<p>Like Pearls is a web-based project created by a mash up of images and GIFS collected from Moreshin Allahyari’s Farsi email spam for online underwear stores located in Iran. Due to Iran’s Islamic laws, the bodies of the models are whited out, erased or covered with a pattern creating a surreal image of sensuality and censorship. Like Pearls examines how the kitsch aesthetics of spam and advertisement on the Iranian web is a complex phenomena, involving layers of cultural and religious censorship and oppression toward women and romance. In Moreshin’s email, she notices a phenomenon called “Gol-Shorti” (Rose/Flower underwear). It’s about men buying undergarments for his lover/wife to surprise her or to please himself. </p>

        <h1>What Makes it Interesting?</h1>
<p>What makes this project interesting is the concept itself. In a country where women are oppressed, aren’t allowed to express themselves and keep a low profile, they still make exceptions when it comes to the male audience, in this case it being lingerie.  One of the main things that Allahyari notices is how the model’s bodies are censored. It isn’t censored with black bars like the foreign magazines that are imported from other countries, but instead they are censored with white, or nice textured patterns which leaves a bit of imagination to the viewer. Upon noticing this, Allahyari thought how messed up and ridiculous the images actually were. </p>

        </div>
<div class="div6"> 
       <h1>What aesthetic choices are made?</h1>
<p>After collecting the images, Allahyari noticed that the ads consisted of hearts, candles, flowers, and birds in order to portray a romantic atmosphere. She also took note of the passive aggressive love language such as “If you leave me, I will come after you.” She states that it is a love that is threatening if it’s not done the way men want it which can lead to hostility and assault. While creating ‘Like Pearls,’ Allahyari is deliberately using the ads in order to display to the viewer the sexual desire and lust that men have.</p>
