        <h1>Femicide: The misogynistic killing of women and girls by men motivated by hatred, contempt, pleasure, or a sense of ownership over women.</h1>

        <p>Femicide is a form of gender violence that is prevalent in Mexico up to this day. Mexico is number 1 with the most femicides in all of Latin America. My concept for this project is to bring attention to femicide since it is not a widely recognized issue. The title, ‘Ni Una Mas’, translates to ‘Not One More’in English. The phrase originated from a poem written by Susana Chavez, who has also fallen victim to femicide. The phrase has become a symbol of the fight against femicide.</p>
<p>On the main page, you see that the images of the women are in black and white and low quality. The reason behind this is that I wanted it to resemble the flyers of missing women that are posted throughout the cities of Mexico. There are some instances that families cannot afford printing vast amounts of flyers in color or they simply do not have a high quality photo of them, which leads them to work with what they have. 
 Once you hover over the image, it reveals a clearer image of the women in color. When you click on the image, you’re able to see their bios and what happened to them.</p> 
<p>These women had dreams and goals that they wanted to achieve in life, but now they never will. I want the viewers to take the time and actually know who they were, to look at them and know that these women were daughters, students, and sisters. It is common that once something tragic happens to a woman, they are diminished to only being recognized for how they died. No one takes the time to remember who they were and what they did when they were alive. Because once a woman is a victim, they’ll forever be known as the victim. No one will ever know what they did while they were alive, or how they contributed to their community. </p>
