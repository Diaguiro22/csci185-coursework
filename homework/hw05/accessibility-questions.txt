Please answer the following accessibility questions:


1. What accessibility corrections did you have to make?

I had to add the alt text for each artist's picture which serves as a description. 
I then had to specifiy that the html language is in English. 
Another thing I'd have to fix is the empty links under the artists. 


2. Do you think your website is usable if you turn off the CSS? Why or why not?

It would not be useful if CSS were turned off since it is what helps the website the be more accessible. 
Examples of this is the legibility of the font on the website, accessible links, and the layout of the website which helps 
keep the artists organized. 


3. Is your site is tabbable? In other words, without the use of the mouse, are all the links and buttons accessible using the tab key?

Yes, it is accessible with the tab key.
